# hackOrSnooze
This is a website for reading and sharing news stories

It is built on the Hack or Snooze API (https://hackorsnoozeapi.docs.apiary.io/#)

The basic structure is made of three classes:

Stories, which contain news stories and information about those particular stories, as well as an individualized ID number
Storylists, which are just lists of stories
and User, which contains methods for logging in, getting credentials, adding stories, deleting stories, and favoriting stories
